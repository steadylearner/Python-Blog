In this post, we will learn how to use [Docker][How to use Docker commands] with Rust web frameworks.

We already have [React and Rust server side code] ready for this. It will be similar to this.

[![user-signup](https://www.steadylearner.com/static/images//post/React/user-signup.png)][React Rust]

Clone the [React Rust] to use it or test with your Rust web projects.

<br />

<h2 class="red-white">[Prerequisite]</h2>

1. Docker
2. Rust

---

I will assume that you are already familiar with Docker and Rust. If you haven't used Docker commands yet, please read [How to use Docker commands].

<br />

<h2 class="blue">Table of Contents</h2>

1. Modify Rust project to dockerize
2. Prepare files to use
3. Make a Docker image with Dockerfile
4. Verify the result in your machine
5. Conclusion

---

<br />

## 1. Modify the Rust project to dockerize

This is maybe the simplest but most important part to save your time. Verify your server side code. In server/actix/src/main.rs of [React Rust], you can see the code similar to this.

```rust
extern crate actix_web;
extern crate actix_files;
extern crate console;

use actix_files as fs;
use actix_web::{App, HttpServer, web, middleware, Result, Responder};

use std::path::PathBuf;

use console::Style;

fn single_page_app() -> Result<fs::NamedFile> {
    let path: PathBuf = PathBuf::from("./public/index.html");
    Ok(fs::NamedFile::open(path)?)
}

pub fn main() {
    std::env::set_var("RUST_LOG", "actix_web=info");
    env_logger::init();

    let blue = Style::new()
        .blue();

    let prefix = "0.0.0.0:";
    let port = 8000; // We will use 80 for aws with env variable.
    let target = format!("{}{}", prefix, port);

    println!("\nServer ready at {}", blue.apply_to(format!("http://{}",&target)));

    HttpServer::new(|| {
        App::new()
            .wrap(middleware::Logger::default())
            .route("/", web::get().to(single_page_app))
            .route("/user", web::get().to(single_page_app))
            .service(fs::Files::new("/", "./public").index_file("index.html"))
    })
    .bind(&target) // Separate prefix, port, target, println! not to show "Not registered service error"
    .unwrap()
    .run()
    .unwrap();
}
```

**Never ever** use **localhost** or **127.0.0.1** etc and only use ports that start with **0.0.0.0.**. This is the same for other web frameworks also.

The port **8000** is used here to synchronize with React frontend made with Webpack. You can use 80 instead when you want to deploy it to AWS. We will learn how to do that in the later [Rust blog posts]

<br />

## 2. Prepare files to use

Rust is compiled language. When you use **cargo run --release**, it makes an executable binary file at **target/release/**.

Its name will be equal to your project name at **Cargo.toml** and will be **react_actix**.

```toml
[package]
name = "react_actix"
```

We don't need other files made from Rust other than that.

We also have some static files for React frontend code to work at **public** folder.

To sum up, you just need to find how to include these to a docker container we will make.

1. **react_actix**
2. **public** folder

It will be no different to use these commands in your console to test it separately in your machine.

```console
$mkdir Docker
$cp react_actix Docker
$cp -R public Docker
$mv Docker && ./react_actix
```

<br />

## 3. Make a Docker image with Dockerfile

In the previous part, we already learnt which files to include in your Docker container.

What left is to decide which base **Docker image** to use and write a few commands in Dockerfile to make all work.

For it is Rust project, it is easy to think we need [the Rust official image from the Dockerhub](https://hub.docker.com/_/rust).

But, we don't need it for we can just execute the **react_actix** binary project with **$./react_actix** inside a Docker container.

You can compare the results.

1. Whatever OS you use in your machine without Rust.

```console
steadylearner/rust          78.4MB
ubuntu                      64.2MB
```

2. With Rust official Docker container.

```console
steadylearner/react_actix   1.64GB
rust                        1.62GB
```

For we already know the difference, we will finally make a **Dockerfile**. It is just the file to include commands we used manually in [How to use Docker commands]. 

It will make a Docker image and not a container and will be similar to this.

```toml
FROM ubuntu # 1.
WORKDIR /app # 2.
# 3.
COPY ./public /app/public
COPY ./target/release/react_actix /app
EXPOSE 8000 # 4.
CMD ["./react_actix"] #5.
```

The process is just to make a virtual development environment similar to your mahcine with Docker. Then, you help it to execute few commands we read in the previous part.

**1.** Use OS or base Docker image you want.

**2.** Use whatever folder name you want for your project.

**3.** We need a static files for React frontend and an executable binary file for **Rust**.

You will only need **COPY ./target/release/react_actix /app** if your project is without frontend code.

**4.** Expose the port you use in your project outside of your docker container.

You can easily verify it with **$curl localhost** later.

**5.** We execute the Rust web app with this. Nothing complicated here.

For **Dockerfile** is ready, make a **./docker-build.bash** file similar to this to make a Docker image with it.

```bash
docker build -t yourdockerhubaccount/rust .
```

Execute it with **./docker-build.bash**. It won't take a long time for Docker to build the image.

Then, you can verify the result with **$docker images**. It will be similar to this.

```console
REPOSITORY                  TAG
yourproject/rust          latest
```

<br />

## 4. Verify the result in your machine

The prepartion ends. Make the Docker conatiner from the image you made with this command.

```console
$docker run -d -p 80:8000 steadylearner/rust
```

You can verify the Docker container is made from the image with this **$docker ps -a**.

It will show the message similar to this.

```console
IMAGE                       COMMAND            PORTS
yourdockerhubaccount/rust   "./react_actix"    0.0.0.0:80->8000/tcp
```

We exposed **8000** port in the previous part. The result of it is **8000/tcp** above.

Then, we used port mapping with **-p 80:8000** and you can see this worked with this.

```console
PORTS
0.0.0.0:80->8000/tcp
```

Everything is ready. Use **$curl localhost** or visit it with your browser. You will see the same image in your browser. Refresh it also to verify the Rust server side code working well.

[![user-signup](https://www.steadylearner.com/static/images//post/React/user-signup.png)][React Rust]

If you want, you can push this to DockerHub with a command similar to **docker push yourdockerhubaccount/rust**.

It is similar to use GitHub and you should make an account and make a repository first.

<br />

## 5. Conclusion

I hope you made it all work. We learnt how to dockerize Rust web app.

We used React production files to make it more meaningful. You could use whatever static files or without them also.

In the later [Rust blog posts], we will learn how to deploy Rust Docker images to **AWS**. It will be easy.

Finding working Rust code is not easy, so I use Express and other frameworks to prototype the projects and write blog posts for them also. If you want to experiment them, please refer to [React Rust] repository.

If you want the latest contents from Steadylearner, follow me at [Twitter] or star [Rust Full Stack].

Do you need **a Full Stack Developer who can use Docker and AWS to deploy the projects**? Contact me with [LinkedIn] or [Twitter] and I will help you.

You can invite me to work with your team. I can learn fast if there is a reason for that.
